# C-Data-Structures 

This is a little library of various data structures, such as

* linked lists
* binary search trees
* red-black-trees
* ...

The implementations are not perfect and rather serve as an excercise for myself. They often use
recursive techniques and are thus not optimal. The focus was rather on clarity than on raw
performance.

## Usage

Each .c file contains a main function and a little test suite which is run upon start. Compile with

`gcc -std=c99 -Wall binary_search_tree.c`
